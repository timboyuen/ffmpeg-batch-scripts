# Introduction

- This is my personal collection of ffmpeg helper batch scripts used in Windows

# Installation 

- Download ffmpeg executables (ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, ffprobe.exe) from official windows build (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows)  [Just get the full build]
- Add the path of the ffmpeg `/bin` folder to the environment variables

```command
setx /M path "%path%;C:\ffmpeg\bin"
```
In Windows, there is a system level PATH variable and a user level PATH variable, that gets concatenated into %PATH% or simply `path` in Command-Prompt.  Using setx /M flag will trigger to modify the user level PATH variable.  This is so you don't accidentally break your own system's PATH variable. 

# Usage

- Drag and drop the file of choice into the batch script.  That is all.
